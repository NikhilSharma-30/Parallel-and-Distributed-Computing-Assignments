4) SendRecv.cpp - Demonstrates basic send and receive operations in communication.

Assignment 2
This assignment covers parallel computing techniques, including sorting, matrix operations, and parallel reductions.

Files:
1) EvenOddSort.cpp - Implements an even-odd sort algorithm in parallel.
2) HeatDistribution.cpp - Simulates heat distribution using computational grids.
3) MatrixMultiply.cpp - Performs matrix multiplication in parallel.
4) MonteCarlo.cpp - Uses Monte Carlo methods for estimation.
5) ParallelDotProduct.cpp - Computes the dot product of two vectors in parallel.
6) ParallelReduction.cpp - Demonstrates parallel reduction techniques.
7) PrefixScan.cpp - Implements a parallel prefix sum (scan) operation.
8) TransposeMatrix.cpp - Performs matrix transposition using parallel computation.

Assignment 3
This assignment deals with numerical computations and optimizations.

Files:
1) CalculatingPi.cpp - Estimates the value of Pi using computational methods.
2) CountPrime.cpp - Counts the number of prime numbers within a given range.
3) DAXPY.cpp - Implements the DAXPY operation (Double-precision AÂ·X Plus Y) for vector computations.

How to Compile and Run

Each C++ file can be compiled using g++ 

Example:

g++ filename.cpp 

-o output
./output

Requirements
1) C++ Compiler (g++)
2) MPI (for message passing programs)
3) OpenMP (for parallel computing programs, if applicable)
